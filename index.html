                <p>This is a language I learned in college for a semester, i learned the bare minimum, for this language but I am actively improving that an example of this is making some simple projects such as a Blackjack game and rock-paper-scissors game.

                <p>I have some experience with JavaScript, but this is the language I want to actively learn as I lack a good knowledge in this area. One such iniative for my desire to learn can be found here on this Website, and other applications I made using in REACT.</p>

                    <h4>Python Blackjack game</h4>
                    <p>This was a small game I made on Python, with the help of freecodecamp. This was my first program actually made on Python. From doing this project I learned many difference from this language compared to Java/C. ew things I learned from the course would be the formating of code in python as i have mainly Java / C coding experience. The existance of F-strings in print statemements and the use of dictionaries in python.</p>
